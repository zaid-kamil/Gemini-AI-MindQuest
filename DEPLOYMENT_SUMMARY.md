## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running
**Cause**: Workflow file not committed
**Fix**: `git add .github/workflows/flutter-pages.yml && git push`

### Pages Not Enabled Error
**Cause**: GitHub Pages source not set to "Actions"
**Fix**: Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"

### 404 Error on Live Site
**Cause**: Base-href mismatch or deployment in progress
**Fix**: Wait 2-3 minutes, check base-href matches repo name

### Blank Page After Deployment
**Cause**: Firebase SDK not loading or missing .nojekyll
**Fix**: Check browser console, verify web/index.html has Firebase scripts

### Build Fails
**Cause**: Dependencies issue or Flutter version mismatch
**Fix**: Check Actions logs, update Flutter version if needed
