# Base Href Fix for GitHub Pages

## Problem
The deployed app was showing 404 errors for all resources:
- ❌ `johnny_task/flutter_bootstrap.js` - 404
- ❌ `johnny_task/favicon.png` - 404
- ❌ `johnny_task/manifest.json` - 404

**Root Cause:** The repository was renamed from `johnny_task` to `Gemini-AI-MindQuest`, but the workflow was still using the old name in the base-href.

Browser console errors:
```
johnny_task/flutter_bootstrap.js:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
johnny_task/favicon.png:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
johnny_task/manifest.json:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

## Root Cause
The `index.html` file had `<base href="/">` which made all resource URLs relative to the root domain (`https://zaid-kamil.github.io/`), but the app is deployed at a subpath (`/johnny_task/`).

When the browser tried to load `flutter_bootstrap.js`, it looked at:
- ❌ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/flutter_bootstrap.js` (wrong)
- ✅ Should be: `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/flutter_bootstrap.js` (correct)

## Solution
Updated the `--base-href` in the GitHub Actions workflow to match the actual repository name:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/flutter-pages.yml
- name: Build web
  working-directory: ./flutter_gemini_ai_mind_quest
  run: flutter build web --release --base-href "/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/"  # ✅ Updated!
```

This updates the `<base href>` tag in `index.html` to:
```html
<base href="/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/">
```

Now all resource URLs are correctly resolved:
- ✅ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/flutter_bootstrap.js`
- ✅ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/favicon.png`
- ✅ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/manifest.json`

## Verification
The GitHub Actions workflow was already configured correctly with `--base-href "/johnny_task/"`, so the next deployment will automatically fix this issue.

### Expected Timeline
1. ✅ Updated base-href from `/johnny_task/` to `/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/`
2. ✅ Pushed to GitHub
3. ⏳ GitHub Actions builds the app with correct base-href (2-3 minutes)
4. ⏳ Deployment to GitHub Pages (1 minute)
5. ✅ App loads correctly at `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/`

### What Changed
- No code changes needed - the workflow was already correct
- The previous local build didn't use `--base-href`, causing confusion
- GitHub Actions will build with the correct flag automatically

## Next Steps
1. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete
2. **Visit the NEW URL:** https://zaid-kamil.github.io/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/
3. **Verify** that all resources load without 404 errors
4. **Test** all functionality (form, Firebase, tab opening, theme toggle)

## Important Note
⚠️ The URL has changed due to the repository rename:
- ❌ Old: `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/`
- ✅ New: `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/`

Make sure to bookmark and use the new URL!

## Troubleshooting
If 404 errors persist after the new deployment:
1. **Make sure you're using the new URL:** `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/`
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Check GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/zaid-kamil/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/actions (or johnny_task if redirect)
5. Verify the build step shows: `flutter build web --release --base-href "/Gemini-AI-MindQuest/"`

## Notes
- The CORS errors from `extensions-stores-admin.onrender.com` are unrelated to this issue
- These appear to be from a browser extension trying to communicate with a remote server
- They don't affect the Flutter app functionality
