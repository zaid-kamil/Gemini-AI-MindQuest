# Base Href Fix for GitHub Pages

## Problem
The deployed app at `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/` was showing 404 errors:
- ❌ `johnny_task/flutter_bootstrap.js` - 404
- ❌ `johnny_task/favicon.png` - 404
- ❌ `johnny_task/manifest.json` - 404

Browser console errors:
```
johnny_task/flutter_bootstrap.js:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
johnny_task/favicon.png:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
johnny_task/manifest.json:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

## Root Cause
The `index.html` file had `<base href="/">` which made all resource URLs relative to the root domain (`https://zaid-kamil.github.io/`), but the app is deployed at a subpath (`/johnny_task/`).

When the browser tried to load `flutter_bootstrap.js`, it looked at:
- ❌ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/flutter_bootstrap.js` (wrong)
- ✅ Should be: `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/flutter_bootstrap.js` (correct)

## Solution
The `--base-href "/johnny_task/"` argument is passed to the `flutter build web` command in the GitHub Actions workflow, which correctly sets the base path:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/flutter-pages.yml
- name: Build web
  working-directory: ./flutter_gemini_ai_mind_quest
  run: flutter build web --release --base-href "/johnny_task/"
```

This updates the `<base href>` tag in `index.html` to:
```html
<base href="/johnny_task/">
```

Now all resource URLs are correctly resolved:
- ✅ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/flutter_bootstrap.js`
- ✅ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/favicon.png`
- ✅ `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/manifest.json`

## Verification
The GitHub Actions workflow was already configured correctly with `--base-href "/johnny_task/"`, so the next deployment will automatically fix this issue.

### Expected Timeline
1. ✅ Push to GitHub (completed)
2. ⏳ GitHub Actions builds the app with correct base-href (2-3 minutes)
3. ⏳ Deployment to GitHub Pages (1 minute)
4. ✅ App loads correctly at `https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/`

### What Changed
- No code changes needed - the workflow was already correct
- The previous local build didn't use `--base-href`, causing confusion
- GitHub Actions will build with the correct flag automatically

## Next Steps
1. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete
2. **Visit** https://zaid-kamil.github.io/johnny_task/
3. **Verify** that all resources load without 404 errors
4. **Test** all functionality (form, Firebase, tab opening, theme toggle)

## Troubleshooting
If 404 errors persist after the new deployment:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/zaid-kamil/johnny_task/actions
4. Verify the build step shows: `flutter build web --release --base-href "/johnny_task/"`

## Notes
- The CORS errors from `extensions-stores-admin.onrender.com` are unrelated to this issue
- These appear to be from a browser extension trying to communicate with a remote server
- They don't affect the Flutter app functionality
